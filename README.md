## Technologies

  This is a full stack app project. The backend is built using Django. The backend data models will include a user model and an exercise model. The frontend is created with React. The styling was be done using React Bootstrap. For this project I uses React Hooks for the first time. This was also be my first time using React Bootstrap on my own. These are my new technologies.
